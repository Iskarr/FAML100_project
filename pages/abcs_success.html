              <p>
                When you think about the ABCs of a successful Meeting, Dating,
                and finally choosing an Eternal Companion, who comes to mind?
                Who comes to mind when you think about who has the best
                relationship you wish to emulate? These are questions that many
                people have especially young people in their 20s. They have been
                either in the dating arena for a while or are just getting their
                feet wet. I am going to throw some facts and information your
                way whether you are jumping into the arena of dating, or have
                been in it for a while. Possibly you are married and need some
                tips about keeping that relationship alive.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first part of this article is that you might have trauma
                from childhood, past relationships, or just from a recent
                experience and that is okay. You do not have to let those
                experiences define your way in relationships. In a study done on
                a group of people, they viewed three groups: those with a
                healthy background, those with a bad background and haven't come
                to terms with the trauma, those who had a bad background but
                came to terms with their trauma. Between the three groups, the
                most effective marriages were from the first group, the third
                group was the second most happy group, and lastly was the middle
                group.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason this is relevant is that if you don't work on trauma
                or issues in your own life, you can't assume to have someone
                else fix your trauma for you. So first tip is to take time to
                evaluate trauma in your life and reach out to a church leader,
                counselor, or trusted friend to work on that trauma and come to
                terms with it so that you won't hold your relationship behind.
                The next tip is about dating, and why it is crucial to never
                leave the dating sphere even if you get married. When we look at
                the dating arena, we think about the struggle of going from
                person to person finding that "perfect" person, and so you jump
                around a lot. When you do find someone or have someone now, you
                must remember to keep the romance alive by dating each other,
                loving each other, and keeping an active interest in each
                other's lives no matter what stage of life you're in currently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Showing how in love you are with your partner throughout life
                can be challenging, but it also is greatly rewarding to
                continuously build that relationship with them. The last tip
                that I have is about understanding the difference between
                immature love and mature love. The reason this is important to
                understand is that you will want to know if your partner or you
                have tendencies of a healthy love life or an unhealthy love
                lifestyle. Things to consider between the two are like this
                below: immature love is about possession, control, jealousy, and
                anxiety. While on the other hand, mature love is about lasting
                passion, desire for companionship, and warm feelings of
                contentment. When you truly love someone you will know that
                having room for growth will include trust, sharing, and
                sacrifice. This is the best advice I can give is always looking
                for healthy ways to allow each partner to grow together.
