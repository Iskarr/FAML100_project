                No matter the relationship, you will have warm and cold days in
                that relationship, and you must understand how to overcome those
                challenges and seek serenity in a world full of stormy days.
                This blog article is about how you can find that serenity even
                with challenges ahead. The first principle that you should be
                aware of would be that you can't avoid those frustrating days
                altogether, it's better to have a plan for when they do come
                than to plan for them to never come.
              </p>
              <p>
                When You look at something as grim as divorce statistics, you
                can see why marriage is on the lower end of the spectrum, as
                shown in the chart below:
              </p>
              <img
                src="../images/divorce.png"
                alt="divorce_data"
                style="width: 100%; height: 80%"
              />
              <p>
                You will see that different states have high or lower divorce
                rates, and its become more common to get a divorce in recent
                years. Although how do you avoid such a devastating action
                between two parties? Having God with you can be a start,
                although building that strong connection with your partner to
                understand them when they are struggling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some people might try to say that marriage is confining to the
                spirit, but when it is done correctly, you'll see that it is a
                way for two souls to connect on a new level that most people who
                are cohabitating cannot quite get because it is so easy to leave
                without any tethers to help you keep that relationship working
                and growing. When you follow the principles about dating and
                keep the romance alive. This can help you avoid this trap of
                feeling like you're in a rut with someone who doesn't love you.
                Another misconception that can be read is that men get more joy
                out of a marriage than women, this information is false and
                according to a study by stack and Eshleman, they found that both
                partners gain a mental benefit from being in a marriage. One way
                that you can avoid more cold than warm in a relationship comes
                to an understanding that when you both focus on the warm, the
                good, and the joy, you will have more of that, joy. This isn't a
                full-proof recipe, nor does it give an immediate way to fix
                problems, but when you're committed to someone and take the time
                to build a good
              </p>
