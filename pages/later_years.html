              <p>
                Something that is covered in this book chapter 9 that many
                people don't discuss as much is how do older couples maintain a
                happy marriage which has lasted 50+ years. What are they doing
                that allows them to stay in a commitment to one another?
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer to that question is much broader than something
                cliche such as "she is always right," "happy wife, happy life,"
                or lastly "never get into arguments." The answer to this
                question is about multiple layers of actions that both partners
                take to reach that level of lasting love. So what is the answer
                to this question?
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A personal commitment to the marriage covenant</li>
                <li>love, friendship, positivity</li>
                <li>the ability to accept influence from one's spouse</li>
                <li>
                  the respectful handling of differences and the ability to
                  solve problems
                </li>
                <li>continual courtship throughout the years.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There is a lot to unpack here, although as you read through this
                last paragraph, look at each one of those bullet points
                carefully. They each represent a part that you have to take in
                becoming a good spouse, wife/husband, and ultimate eternal
                companion for whomever you might choose to be with forever.
                <br />
                When you commit to someone in a marriage covenant, you are
                giving them all of yourself and allowing them to give you the
                same, and the commitment that you make ultimately goes to God
                and is a promise between you both. love, friendship, and
                positivity are all traits that help maintain a healthy
                relationship and continually foster healthy behaviors in the
                marriage. <br />
                The ability to accept influence and solve problems can be
                condensed down to compromising on problems and working on a
                problem together rather than alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                respectfully handling differences means that you will again
                learn to accept the person for who they are wholehearted.
                Lastly, continuing that romance is of huge importance if you
                plan to make this relationship work for eternity. You cannot get
                married and assume that you no longer have to do romantic
                gestures for your spouse. <br />
                On the contrary, you should be more in love with the person you
                have committed to for life. This isn't going to answer all the
                questions you might have but this gives a great start to what
                you need to think about when it comes to making an eternal
                decision that will ultimately help you have a lasting marriage
                in this temporal world and the one to come.
